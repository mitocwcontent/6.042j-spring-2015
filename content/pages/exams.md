Solutions to the following Exams are not available to the general public, as the assignments took substantial effort to compose—often 4-6 hours per problem—so it is essential that the course staff be able to re-use problems in later terms. Instructors or their students at recognized institutions may contact Prof. Meyer to request solutions on a case-by-case basis.
